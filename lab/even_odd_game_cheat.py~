#	Rules: Play multiple rounds with the computer.    #
#       In each round, both computer and user pick    #
#		a number, if the sum is odd,                  #
#		computer wins a round; if the                 #
#		sum is even, you win a round.                 #
#       The first one to win enough                   #
#       rounds win the game.                          #
